incompleteness theorems, developed for McGill's Intermediate Logic
course, based on the Open Logic Project.

This repository/directory only contains the LaTeX files and
illustrations needed to typeset the textbook _Intermediate logic_,
which in turn requires the _[Open Logic
Text](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/)_.

To install and compile:

- Download/install the _Open Logic Text_ from
  [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/), including
  [photos](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/photos) if you want those.
- Navigate to the subdirectory `courses/`
- Put the content of this repository into a subdirectory of it, say
  `courses/intermediate-logic`.

If you use `git`, this should do it:
```
# git clone https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic.git
# cd OpenLogic/courses
# git clone https://github.com/rzach/intermediate-logic.git
# cd ../assets
# git clone https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/portraits.git
# git clone https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/photos.git
```
Inside `courses/intermediate-logic`, you can now compile:
```
# pdflatex il-screen
```
or just `# make` if you have `latexmk` installed. (You'll also have to
do `bibtex il-screen` for the bibliography.)

The file `il-screen.tex` produces a color version of the text with
smaller margins for screen reading. `il-print` produces a
black-and-white version designed for printing on Crown Quarto stock
(without cover).

The file loads `ic.tex`, which contains the actual material. It
in turn includes other files, most of them from the `OpenLogic`
repository. So you won't get a complete book unless you download into
the right subdirectory of and compile from there.
